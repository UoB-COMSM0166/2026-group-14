# Paper Prototype 2 — Player Feedback 

#### Challenge 1: Difficult to balance the difficulty
**Typical manifestations:**
- types of traps, timing of implementation are unclear.
- map design needs to be both fun and challengable


#### Challenge 2: Multiplayers mode is unclear
**Typical manifestations:**
- how should players work together?
- should there be different tasks for different players?
- should the players act independently or be chained to each other for more challenge?

#### Possible gamedesign

#### 1. Clear Objective: 
**Goal:** Players should achieve the same goal to finish the game, for example get the jewelry which is on the other side of the map

#### 2 Unexpected traps
**Goal:** There are traps being hidden for the first time, players can not see them until they trigger them. It makes the game more unpredictable and challenging.

#### 3 Hidden info
**Goal:** In order to avoid some hard traps, players have to get the info which will unlock more hidden items or mechanism that will make the game easier.
